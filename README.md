Armenian ASCII encoding to Unicode converter

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
This a small project I wrote sometime in 2008 when Unicode.
encoding for Armenian was just starting. I had numerous files.
in ASCII encoding that needed to be converted into Unicode..
Thus, this program came up. I hope it will be useful for someone.

 % make clean
 
 % make

To use it run the executable and provide it with the file to be converted:

 % ./ascii2unihy some_ascii_file.txt
