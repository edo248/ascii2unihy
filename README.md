Armenian ASCII encoding to Unicode converter

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
This a small project I wrote sometime in 2008 when Unicode.
encoding for Armenian was just starting. I had numerous files.
in ASCII encoding that needed to be converted into Unicode..
Thus, this program came up. I hope it will be useful for someone.

Note that I have only tested it for my own needs, so there is
no guarantee it will be useful at all. If there are questions.
or bugs you want me to know, feel free to drop me a note.

To use it run the executable and provide it with the file to be converted:

 % ./ascii2uni some_ascii_file.txt
